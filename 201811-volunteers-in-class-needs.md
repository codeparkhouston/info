# About

For Fall 2018 and early Spring 2019 semesters, Code Park is running code clubs and we need your help in the classroom!

Throughout these weekly clubs, students use computer science to tell fun and interactive stories through [Storytelling](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/c/cs-first/en/storytelling/overview.html){:target="_blank"} or team up to tell the story of how their friendship started and imagine a company together through [Friends](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/c/cs-first/en/friends/overview.html){:target="_blank"}.

As a volunteer in the classroom, you'll [encourage students](http://bit.ly/codeparkorientation){:target="_blank"} to:

* solve problems
* be creative
* explore
* work together, and
* reflect on their learning process.

You'll also be helping the classroom lead with classroom setup and troubleshooting computer issues.

For more information about us and how we work with students, see our [training guide here](http://bit.ly/codeparkorientation){:target="_blank"}.  We'll also cover this with you if you're new to our classrooms.
